## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Native response metadata and text block state
Streaming SHALL preserve represented native identity and sequential text-block state, validate required/optional fields before output and retain terminal/commitment authority. Route identity SHALL not fabricate native fields or alter independent configured/BYOK observation.

#### Scenario: Native response metadata and text block state policy
- **WHEN** the activated Gateway enforces this contract
- **THEN** After public start and within the provider-part limit, the state machine SHALL accept at most one response-metadata part before payload output, sequential text blocks, independent tool events under gateway-streaming-function-tools, supported reasoning/sources under their capabilities, non-terminal provider errors and exactly one finish. Response metadata SHALL copy representable native ResponseID, ModelID and Timestamp at registered id, modelId and timestamp fields. Nonempty native strings SHALL remain unchanged; optional empty Go strings and zero timestamps SHALL be omitted as documented unrepresentable-presence adaptations. A nonzero timestamp SHALL encode a validated UTC RFC3339Nano instant. A provider metadata part with no identity SHALL contain only its type. The runtime SHALL NOT synthesize missing metadata or substitute requested/canonical route identity. Provider identity, headers and opaque metadata remain outside this scoped identity change.
- **AND** Configured canonical identity SHALL remain authoritative for configured resolution and operator logical metrics, separately from returned identity. BYOK selection and observation SHALL instead follow the request-scoped identity and bounded-cardinality rules in gateway-text-observability, without catalog lookup or response-derived logical identity. Each text-start ID SHALL remain nonempty, valid UTF-8 and globally unique within its stream, opening the only active text block. Deltas/ends SHALL use its active ID and required empty deltas SHALL survive. Provider errors SHALL not change text/metadata state. Existing reasoning/source/tool first-output placement rules SHALL remain effective. New native identity strings and timestamp bytes SHALL participate in preflight and complete-frame bounds before any write.

#### Scenario: Native metadata precedes output
- **WHEN** a configured provider emits native response identity different from requested alias and canonical route before payload output
- **THEN** the event SHALL preserve the native values without changing route resolution or canonical operator metrics

#### Scenario: BYOK native identity differs from request identity
- **WHEN** a BYOK provider emits native response identity different from the requested provider/model
- **THEN** the event SHALL preserve representable native values while logical observation retains its request-scoped identity and fixed model metric class
- **AND** neither identity SHALL trigger catalog lookup

#### Scenario: Metadata has partial or no native identity
- **WHEN** the provider emits partial identity or an identity-free metadata part
- **THEN** only supplied representable fields SHALL appear, with no canonical fallback
- **AND** no metadata part SHALL be manufactured for a provider that emitted none

#### Scenario: Native model ID is not a public route
- **WHEN** modelId contains valid native Unicode, spaces or punctuation outside public route syntax
- **THEN** the native modelId SHALL remain unchanged within the complete-frame budget

Each text-start, text-delta and text-end SHALL preserve supported opaque providerMetadata at its original event position under gateway-provider-metadata, including absent versus explicit empty presence. Content metadata SHALL NOT be moved into response-metadata.

#### Scenario: Sequential text blocks are valid
- **WHEN** a provider emits multiple non-overlapping text start/delta/end blocks with unique IDs
- **THEN** all events SHALL be emitted in order and empty delta strings SHALL remain present

#### Scenario: Text lifecycle is invalid
- **WHEN** a text ID is empty, invalid UTF-8, reused, mismatched, opened while another text block is active, or ended without an active matching block
- **THEN** the handler SHALL cancel provider work and attempt at most one synthetic terminal internal error

#### Scenario: Metadata placement is invalid
- **WHEN** metadata is duplicated or arrives after text, tool, reasoning or source output starts
- **THEN** it SHALL not be forwarded and the existing safe terminal behavior SHALL apply

#### Scenario: Metadata representation exceeds bounds
- **WHEN** native identity contains invalid UTF-8, an invalid timestamp or yields an over-limit complete frame
- **THEN** no metadata bytes SHALL be written and at most one safe terminal error SHALL be attempted

#### Scenario: Text metadata changes at end
- **WHEN** text-start supplies an object, text-delta omits metadata and text-end supplies an empty or replacement object
- **THEN** those exact metadata positions and presence states SHALL reach both clients in order, with no deep merge or relocation
