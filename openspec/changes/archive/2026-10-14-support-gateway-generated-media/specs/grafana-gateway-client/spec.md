## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Independent generated-file response decoding
The Apache Grafana client SHALL decode registered generated files in unary and streaming responses without importing Gateway code. It SHALL preserve data/URL values, optional originalUrl, media type, metadata presence and ordering under its existing cumulative, event-count and response limits. Provider-local filenames SHALL not become normalized generated-file fields.

#### Scenario: Generated file response is decoded
- **WHEN** the server returns a valid generated file using data or URL in unary or SSE output
- **THEN** the client SHALL expose the corresponding provider file value with metadata intact and selected empty data preserved

#### Scenario: Malformed or oversized response
- **WHEN** a generated file has malformed consumed fields or exceeds client limits
- **THEN** existing bounded protocol-error, cancellation and body-ownership behavior SHALL terminate consumption

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Incremental bounded SSE consumption

A successful streaming setup SHALL require SSE media type and return a `StreamResult` whose request body and response headers are client-owned. One goroutine SHALL own the body, parse incrementally under configured cumulative-byte, complete-event-byte, and event-count limits, send mapped parts with context-aware backpressure, close the body, and close the output channel exactly once. It SHALL not buffer the full response or an unbounded line/event.

#### Scenario: Text stream completes
- **WHEN** the server emits valid start, metadata, sequential text parts, safe errors, and finish frames
- **THEN** the client SHALL deliver every accepted part in order, including required empty deltas and finish, then close the channel

#### Scenario: Consumer is slow
- **WHEN** result delivery blocks and the call context is canceled
- **THEN** the stream owner SHALL stop the blocked send, close the response body, close the channel, and leave no client-owned goroutine reading the stream

#### Scenario: SSE resource limit is crossed
- **WHEN** cumulative bytes, complete event bytes, or event count exceeds its configured limit
- **THEN** the client SHALL stop reading, emit at most one bounded protocol error when delivery remains possible, and close all owned resources

#### Scenario: Unsupported response family is received
- **WHEN** the client receives custom, approval or another unsupported later-package stream part
- **THEN** it SHALL produce an explicit protocol error rather than decoding through provider-domain JSON accidentally

#### Scenario: Hosted dynamic call with preview results
- **WHEN** valid tool input, a provider-owned dynamic call, preliminary results and a final result arrive before finish
- **THEN** all parts and enabled markers SHALL be delivered in order, with false Dynamic/Preliminary pointer presence and input-start dynamic presence retained and final-event-before-EOF behavior unchanged

#### Scenario: Input-start dynamic is presence-sensitive
- **WHEN** otherwise equivalent input-start events omit dynamic or contain false or true
- **THEN** the client SHALL preserve nil, false and true respectively for subsequent core inference

#### Scenario: Deferred result is consumed
- **WHEN** the current request carries an unresolved provider-owned call in history and the response contains only its result and finish
- **THEN** the client SHALL deliver the success or error result without demanding a repeated call or adding a result-level providerExecuted wire member
